    <p>He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away! Not for the men they cheat on. Oh, I'm sorry Morty, are you the scientist or are you the kid who wanted to get laid? That guy is the Red Grin Grumbold of pretending he knows what's going on. Oh you agree huh? You like that Red Grin Grumbold reference? Well guess what, I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep.

    You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games? Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man. Aww, gee, you got me there, Rick. We're gonna nine eleven this bitch unless Morty gets better math grades!</p>
