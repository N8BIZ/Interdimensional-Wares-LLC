    <h1>Interdimensional Wares LLC</h1>
    <p>The universe renown Interdimensional Wares, LLC (I.W.) was founded somewhere within the Milkyway Galaxy by the one of Earths first A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) Watson. It’s assumed Watson developed the company in the shadows of Mars when the humans first colonized the planet. </p>
    <p>Watson intentionally automated I.W. to require the assistance of specific individuals amongst diverse life-forms throughout the ever expanding universe.  The algorithm for his recruiting method is unknown, but perfect in execution. Boasting prominent human employees such as: Miriam Quintana, Steve Kornahrens, and Nathan Bauer of Earth.</p>
    <p>The monolithic I.W. boasts the highest earnings of any company in the known universe.  Distributing it’s goods and services from Epsilon-1468 to the outskirts of Border-9099. What’s most interesting though is the A.I. founder, Watson, seeks no financial compensation. Instead the profits are either re-invested into various facets of I.W. or paid to employees.</p>
    <p>I.W.‘s feverous commitment of creating equality for all species through readily available goods and services across the universe continues to surge at speeds faster than light!</p>

      <h3>Steve Kornahrens</h3>
      <p>Steve didn't really want to join the organization to be honest. The team at Interdimensional Wares LLC at the time, only Watson, had been monitoring him since July 10th, 2017. For whatever reason he doesn't seem to mind HTML and CSS and someone had to build this site afterall. Watson abducted Steve shortly after the year 2018 and he's been happily with the company ever since. Please don't ask if he was captured, haha he doesn't remember and you'll just confuse him. Silly Steve.</p>

      <p>Steve is originally from South Carolina. A vile place full of mosquitos and ants. No wonder we found him in Colorado before he "joined" the I.W. LLC. Steve is only capable of speaking in English but prefers to speak through Google Translate, as it has a spell checker. Before joining the company Steve worked at a Sticker and Label factory were he pretended to be important. Ohhhh a Tech Director, you're so fancy Steve. Get out of here. When Steve isn't working he likes to go back to earth to catch trout, which we take from him immediately.</p>

      <p>Steve fantasizes about going to On The Cob Planet some day. He would love to catch trout on the cob or hunt for pheasant on the cob.</p>
